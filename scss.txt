SASS/SCSS

SASS is nothing but CSS Preprocessor
(CSS with superpowers)

SCSS- CSS3
SASS- CSS

Watch Sass --> Live compilation of SASS or SCSS to CSS

Difference btw CSS and SCSS
In SCSS, we can use
1- Operators
2- Variables
3- Nesting
   Nesting me we can use ampersand symbol (&).
4- Mixin
   ▪️If we think some properties (like display:flex, justify-content,align-item, flex-direction) will come again and again then use mixin
   use @ symbol  @mixin and write @include to include where required
5- Parameters
6- Partials
   ▪️We can add all @mixin in another page, and then call later
   ▪️we create different page for all
   ▪️Use ( _ ) , to tell sass compiler that dont touch this partial file, no need to compile or anything.
   ▪️Only compile main.scss to convert into main.css.
